It is a client side JS library.
It creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
React only changes what needs to be changed.
It is all about building modern reactive user interfaces for the web.
Declarative, component-focused approach.

React can be used to control parts of HTML pages or entire pages.
'Widget' approach on a multi-page-application.
Some pages are still rendered on and served by a backend server.
Here some part of the page in controlled by react.

React can also used to control the entire frontend of a web application.
Single page application (SPA) approach.
Server only sends one HTML page. therafter, React takes over and control the UI.

Elements are the smallest building block of React apps.
An element describes what you want to see on the screen.
In '<div id="root"></div>', the root here is called DOM Node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.
Therefore we render a React element into a root DOM Node.
React elements are immutable. i.e. once you create an element you cant change it children or attributes.
But we can update the UI is to create a new element


React Componenets are made of element(s).
React is all about components.
We build these individual components and then we tell react how to compose them together into a final user interface.
Classes or functions are used for creating components in React.
Componenets gives features like reuseability and seperation of concerns.

Mostly react is all about combining HTML and JAVASCRIPT together and then we can also add css but that's not the focus of React.
React uses declarative approach which defines the desired target state(s) and let react figure out the actual Javascript DOM instructions.
And then react figures out which element should be update, delete or displyed on the webpage.

JSX - JavaScript XML
It converts HTML tags into react elements. 
In react we must have one root element per return statement / per JSX statement. We cannot use two <div></div> inside one return statement.
But we can create a div inside a div. i.e. there must be only one main div and inside this main div we can mave multiple divs.
We can store JSX content in variables.
After compilation, JSX expressions becomes regular JavaScript function calls.

A component cannot use data stored in other components.
Props in react are simple properties that we can use for outter components, just the same as we use in HTML components.
A parent compenent owns the prop and cannot be changed by the child component.
We can use props to share the data between two or more compenents.

we have a distinct props object for every component and for every instance of some component.       

The process of building an user interface from smaller building blocks is called composition in React.
Composition are generally used as "Wrapper components" that add certain styling around the wrapped components.
We cannot use our custom components as wrappers around other kind of content.
having content inside a custom component does not work as same as default html tags.

So to build such wrappers components we use children props
props.children contains all the content which is specified between the opening tag and closing tag of our custom components.


States and lisiting to user events helps us to change the content/interact with the page.
State in React -
States in the component changes over time. The changes in the state happens over time which can be done by a user or can be a system event.
A state represents the component's local state or information. We can only modify the state inside that compenent



useState() - It registers the state for a specified component instance.
i.e. If we have used the component(function) for multiple times, then for each of them this useState function will create a seperate state.
Hence when each of the components is called it creates a different states for each of them.
That is the reason why after updating one component the others are not affected because each one has seperate state.
REACT SCHEDULES STATE UPDATES, IT DOESNT PERFORMS THEM INSTANTLY.
Using state we can implement 2 way binding which means that for inputs we just dont listen to changes but also pass a new value back to the input. So we can reset or change the values
We are passing date from child compenent to parent component by passing this data to the function we got from parent class. This is called lifting up of state/data.











MOVING DATA FROM CHILD COMPONENT TO PARENT COMPONENT --> 
We can do this by using props and get a function from parent compenent into child component and then passing the date into that component.


Working with FRAGMENTS, PORTALS, REFS
LIMITATION OF JSX :-->
1. We cannot render 2 JSX elements next to each other. i.e. we cannot return more than one root JSX elements from the return statement.

To avoid using multiple divs / creating div soup we use fragments. 
FRAGMENTS allows us to write neat and clean code.



You must add all "things" you use in your effect function if those "things" could change because your component (or some parent component) re-rendered.
userEffect runs after completion of every components rendering cycle, IF WE DONT PASS THE SECOND ARGUMENT WHICH IS AN ARRAY.
But if you pass the second argument as an array then the effect function will run for the first time, but not for the subsequent render cycle.
And if you pass any dependencies in the array then this effect function will run whenever the dependencies is present or valid.







React hooks can be recongnized by the fact that they start with the word hooks.
And all these hooks must be only called inside of react components.
They can't be called outside of component functions and they also should't called inside a nested functions.
Basic hooks :--
 1. useState()
 2. useEffect()
 3. useReducer() : Replacement to useState(). For more complex and powerful state management
